[Bezier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) define a polynomial path via control points.

#### Handles as Velocity

However, it's also possible to think of bezier curves as defining kinematic systems.  

If the handles on a cubic bezier curve represent the starting and ending velocity of a trajectory, then the second derivative of the curve is the acceleration needed to navigate between those two states.
